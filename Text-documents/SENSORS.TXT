One heat sensor before the heatsink (On motor) (Done) - This would be graphed using a normal graph.
One heat sensor on the heatsink (Done) - This would be graphed using a normal graph.
Current draw sensor (With specs of motor and better) (Done) - This would be graphed using a normal graph.
Speed sensor - This will be graphed with a speedometer.


Sensors which might be nice to add:

Tilt Switch Sensor
Strain Gauge
Tire Temprature Sensors
Tire Pressure Sensors
Gyro Sensor
Gyro sensor in the steering wheel. (This would have a 3d simulation in the gui)
Braking sensors.
